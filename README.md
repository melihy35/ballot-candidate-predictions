## Description

The Ballot Candidate Predictions project leverages various Python libraries to create a predictive model for election ballot candidates. This project focuses on using data analysis and machine learning to predict the potential success of candidates in an election based on various factors and attributes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries and frameworks installed:

- Python 3.7+
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for data visualization.
- [OpenCV (cv2)](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) for image processing.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) for numerical computations.
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for building and training machine learning models.
- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) for model evaluation and data splitting.

You can install these prerequisites using the following command:

```bash
pip install matplotlib opencv-python numpy tensorflow scikit-learn
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/melihy35/ballot-candidate-predictions.git
cd ballot-candidate-prediction
```

2. Start working with the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to analyze and predict candidate outcomes.
